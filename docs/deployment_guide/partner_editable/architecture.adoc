image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/mulesoft-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets, Kubernetes nodes running Runtime Fabric services in an Auto Scaling group.
* An Application Load Balancer (not shown) to route traffic to the Mule API instances in the private subnets.
* Amazon EKS, which provides the Kubernetes control plane for the cluster.
* AWS Systems Manager to manage Mule deployments automatically.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
