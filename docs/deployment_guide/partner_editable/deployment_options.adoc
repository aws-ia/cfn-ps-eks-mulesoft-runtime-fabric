// Edit this placeholder text as necessary to describe the deployment options.

This Quick Start provides the following deployment options:

* https://fwd.aws/PRJmG?[Deploy into a new VPC and a new Amazon EKS cluster^]
* https://fwd.aws/MbWKn?[Deploy into an existing VPC and a new Amazon EKS cluster^]
* https://fwd.aws/mVDyp?[Deploy into an existing VPC and an existing Amazon EKS cluster^]

This Quick Start uses the same template for all three options. The first two options launch the https://fwd.aws/zz59x?[Amazon EKS Quick Start^] with the `MuleSoftRtfIntegration` parameter set to *Enabled*. Then, after the new EKS cluster is deployed, the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start is deployed as a submodule.

For all three options, you can configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.
